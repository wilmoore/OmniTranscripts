# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting significant technical decisions.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR captures the context, decision, and consequences of an architecturally significant choice.

## Format

We use the [Michael Nygard format](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Naming Convention

- Filename: `NNNN-kebab-case-title.md` (e.g., `0001-use-localStorage-for-tracking.md`)
- NNNN = zero-padded sequence number (0001, 0002, 0003...)
- Title in heading must match: `# NNNN. Title` (e.g., `# 0001. Use localStorage for Tracking`)
