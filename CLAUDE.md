## Architecture Overview

### Dual Consumption Model
OmniTranscripts supports two consumption modes from one codebase:

1. **Go Library** (`engine/` package): Direct programmatic use via import
2. **HTTP API**: Thin adapter over the engine for external clients

The transcription engine is transport-agnostic. HTTP concerns live at the edge only.

### Core Processing Pipeline
The application implements a three-stage media transcription pipeline:

1. **Download Stage** (`engine/engine.go`): Uses yt-dlp to extract audio from any supported URL (1000+ platforms)
2. **Normalize Stage**: Uses ffmpeg-go to convert audio to 16kHz mono WAV format suitable for whisper.cpp
3. **Transcription Stage**: Transcribes using whisper.cpp (native, server, or demo fallback)

### Structured Errors
The `engine.TranscriptionError` type provides stage-specific error reporting:
- `StageDownload`: Download failures (network, unsupported URL, etc.)
- `StageNormalize`: Audio conversion failures
- `StageTranscribe`: Transcription failures

### Job Processing System
**Sync vs Async Decision**: Media <=2 minutes processes synchronously with real-time response polling. Longer media uses async job queue with job ID for status checking.

**Job States** (`jobs/job.go`): `pending` → `running` → `complete`/`error`

**Job Queue** (`jobs/queue.go`): Thread-safe in-memory map with read/write mutex. Single global instance initialized in main.go.

**Processing Flow** (`handlers/transcribe.go`):
- `PostTranscribe`: Creates job → determines sync/async based on duration → launches goroutine
- `GetTranscribeJob`: Returns job status and results for async jobs
- Background processing calls `lib.ProcessTranscription` which orchestrates the pipeline

**Detailed architecture documentation:** [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)

### Package Organization
- `main.go`: Fiber server setup, middleware, routing, MCP server mounting
- `engine/`: **Public library package** - core transcription types and functions
- `config/`: Environment variable management with defaults
- `handlers/`: HTTP request handlers and response logic
- `jobs/`: Job data structures and thread-safe queue implementation
- `lib/`: Internal utilities (auth middleware, subtitles, webhooks)
- `mcp/`: MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for ChatGPT integration
- `models/`: Request/response structs and URL validation
- `scripts/`: Performance testing automation

### External Dependencies
**Runtime Requirements**: The application uses external binaries:
- `yt-dlp`: For media downloads (any supported URL)
- `ffmpeg`: For audio processing
- `whisper.cpp`: For transcription (optional, has demo fallback)

**Go Libraries**:
- `github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2`: HTTP framework (Express-like for Go)
- `github.com/lrstanley/go-ytdlp`: Go wrapper for yt-dlp
- `github.com/u2takey/ffmpeg-go`: Go wrapper for FFmpeg
- `github.com/google/uuid`: Job ID generation
- `github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go`: MCP protocol implementation for ChatGPT integration

## Key Implementation Details

### Authentication
Bearer token authentication via `lib.AuthMiddleware()` checks `Authorization: Bearer <token>` against `API_KEY` environment variable. Health endpoint bypasses authentication.

### File Management
Temporary files created in `WORK_DIR` with job ID naming. Automatic cleanup via defer statements in processing functions.

### Error Handling
Structured errors via `engine.TranscriptionError` provide stage-specific context. Errors propagate up through the pipeline with wrapping. Job errors stored in Job.Error field and returned via API.

### Testing Architecture
- Unit tests in `handlers/transcribe_test.go` with Fiber test framework
- Performance benchmarks in `lib/transcription_bench_test.go`
- Load testing with configurable concurrency and performance assertions
- Performance test runner script at `scripts/run_perf_tests.sh`

### Configuration Patterns
Environment variables loaded once at startup via `config.Load()`. No runtime config changes supported.

## API Endpoints

### HTTP API
- `GET /health`: Unauthenticated health check
- `POST /transcribe`: Submit media URL, returns transcript (sync) or job ID (async)
- `GET /transcribe/{job_id}`: Get job status and results

Request/response handled via `models.TranscribeRequest` and `models.TranscribeResponse` structs.

### MCP Server (ChatGPT Integration)
- `POST/GET/DELETE /mcp`: MCP protocol endpoint for ChatGPT Apps SDK
- Tools: `transcribe_url` (start transcription), `get_transcription` (check status/retrieve results)

**ChatGPT integration guide:** [docs/chatgpt-integration.md](docs/chatgpt-integration.md)

## Development Notes

- Use `make dev` for development server with automatic restarts
- Tests require external dependencies (yt-dlp, ffmpeg, whisper.cpp) to pass fully
- Load tests have strict performance requirements that may fail without external deps
- The `parseDuration` function currently returns hardcoded 120 seconds (TODO: implement actual parsing)
- Job queue is in-memory only - jobs lost on restart (suitable for MVP)

## Troubleshooting Reference

For common issues and solutions:
- **External tool dependencies**: whisper.cpp, yt-dlp, ffmpeg installation issues
- **Processing failures**: Job stuck in pending, download/transcription errors
- **Performance issues**: Memory usage, slow processing, disk space
- **Deployment problems**: Docker, cloud platform, networking issues
